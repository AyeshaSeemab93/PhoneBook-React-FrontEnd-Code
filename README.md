# PhoneBook React Application

Welcome to the PhoneBook React Application! This project is a simple phonebook application developed using Vite. The app allows users to add new contacts with names and numbers and filter the displayed contacts.

## Project Overview

- **Project Repository:** [PhoneBook React FrontEnd Code](https://github.com/AyeshaSeemab93/PhoneBook-React-FrontEnd-Code)
- **Live Demo:** [PhoneBook React Application Demo](https://ayeshaseemab93.github.io/PhoneBook-React-FrontEnd-Code/)

## About the App

The PhoneBook React Application is created using Vite, a fast and opinionated React project setup. Vite provides a streamlined development experience with features like lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized build times.

### Features

- Add new contacts with names and numbers.
- Filter and display contacts based on search criteria.

### Data Source

The application fetches data from a JSON server, and unfortunately, the list of numbers cannot be fetched on GitHub Pages due to limitations in server-side operations. To experience the full functionality, run the project locally using the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev         # Run the front-end development server
npm run server      # Start the JSON server to provide data
```

## Getting Started
